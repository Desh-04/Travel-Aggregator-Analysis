# Travel Aggregator Analysis

## Project Overview:
This project explores travel booking data from a travel aggregator platform to uncover business insights and user behavior trends.
Using Python, I performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to answer real-world questions such as:

1. Which days have the highest bookings?

2. What are the most popular routes and devices used?

3. How early do customers book from top cities?

4. What’s the monthly and weekly Booking-to-Search Ratio (oBSR) trend?

## Skills & Techniques:
 * Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
 * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 * Data Visualization (Pie charts, Heatmaps, Time Series)
 * Statistical & Trend Analysis

## Tools & Libraries:
* Python 
* Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
* Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
* Scikit-learn – Scaling & normalization

## Key Insights:
* Thursdays & Fridays showed the highest number of bookings.
* Top 3 advance-booking cities revealed strong early-planning customer behavior.
* Mobile devices dominated booking activity across quarters.
* oBSR analysis helped understand conversion from searches to actual bookings.

## Data Preparation
1. Removed missing values & duplicates

2. Fixed inconsistent data types

3. Stripped unwanted whitespaces

4. Scaled and normalized numerical columns

## Project Highlights

1. Designed visual summaries using pastel-themed heatmaps & pie charts

2. Analyzed service-wise performance and device usage trends

3. Created quarterly time series plots for booking patterns

## Outcome:

Helped identify booking behavior patterns that can support:
1. Marketing strategies (target high-booking days/cities)

2. Platform optimization (improve mobile experience)

3. Revenue insights through oBSR trends

## Future Enhancements

* Add predictive analysis for demand forecasting.

* Create an interactive dashboard (Tableau/Power BI).

* Automate monthly booking trend reports.
