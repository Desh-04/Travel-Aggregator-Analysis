Travel Aggregator Analysis
Project Overview

This project explores travel booking data from a travel aggregator platform to uncover business insights and user behavior trends.
Using Python, I performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to answer real-world questions such as:

Which days have the highest bookings?

What are the most popular routes and devices used?

How early do customers book from top cities?

What’s the monthly and weekly Booking-to-Search Ratio (oBSR) trend?

Skills & Techniques

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Data Visualization (Pie charts, Heatmaps, Time Series)
✅ Statistical & Trend Analysis

Tools & Libraries

Python 

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Scaling & normalization

Key Insights

Thursdays & Fridays showed the highest number of bookings.
 Top 3 advance-booking cities revealed strong early-planning customer behavior.
 Mobile devices dominated booking activity across quarters.
 oBSR analysis helped understand conversion from searches to actual bookings.

 Data Preparation

Removed missing values & duplicates

Fixed inconsistent data types

Stripped unwanted whitespaces

Scaled and normalized numerical columns

 Project Highlights

Designed visual summaries using pastel-themed heatmaps & pie charts

Analyzed service-wise performance and device usage trends

Created quarterly time series plots for booking patterns

 Outcome

Helped identify booking behavior patterns that can support:

Marketing strategies (target high-booking days/cities)

Platform optimization (improve mobile experience)

Revenue insights through oBSR trends
